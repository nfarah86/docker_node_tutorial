Hopefully some helpful documentation if someone is doing the tutorial (link below) with Docker:

	Docker site node js example hello world: 
		https://docs.docker.com/examples/nodejs_web_app/#run-the-image

		Download: http://boot2docker.io/ 

Initial problems with docker: 
	FATA[0000] Post http:///var/run/docker.sock/v1.16/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: no such file or directory. Are you trying to connect to a TLS-enabled daemon without TLS? 

BREAK IT DOWN, HOMIE-G: What is TLS?
	Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that ensures privacy between communicating applications and their users on the Internet. When a server and client communicate, TLS ensures that no third party may eavesdrop or tamper with any message. TLS is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
		->source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security

    Further explanation ov HTTPS vs TLS. vs SSL are here:
		http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5126/whats-the-difference-between-ssl-tls-and-https

  may be I need a TLS ?!!

  Why YES, I DO, I DO, I DO OOOOOO...
		https://docs.docker.com/articles/certificates/
			->above link wouldn't work, I have a mac: 
			Warning: These TLS commands will only generate a working set of certificates on Linux. The version of OpenSSL in Mac OS X is incompatible with the type of certificate Docker requires.

			->Didn't use this link, but may be it might help someone 

		https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/blob/master/README.md

			-->by doing on the commandline after $: 
				bash-3.2$ boot2docker shellinit

				--> above link and command fixed the problem by setting the DOCKER_HOST envir.

		
		This command failed for me: 
			 curl -i localhost:49160
		
		This TOTALLY FIXED MY PROBLEM: 

			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25144288/docker-container-with-node-and-express-on-mac-not-showing-in-browser

			use on commandline:
			bash-3.2$ curl -i "$(boot2docker ip):49160"

		Curl manual: what does -i and -s mean?:
